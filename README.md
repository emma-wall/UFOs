# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this repo was to create a website that would display UFO sightings data from a file in a table format. To make this table interactive I created filters that allow user input enter a date, city, country and/or shape that will filter the results of the table. 

## Results
To filter the table, simply input criteria in the input fields on the page. In the image below, the user was looking for UFO sightings in CA with the shape of a triangle.

## Summary 
Overall this is a functional website, but has some limitations. First, the data is very limited and only spans from 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010. The data also needs to be cleaned up making the duration consistent and cleaning up the comments section. 

It is not clear that if you click the ‘UFO Sightings’ on the top of the page it will clear the data, so to improve this, I would add a clear filter button to return to the original table with all the sighting and the user would not have to delete each field manually. I would also improve this page by adding a filter function to the city, state, country, shape and duration columns, that way the user can look at all of the data by sorting the various columns instead of filtering .
